    <title>Transforming Raising Cane’s Supply Chain</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Subtle Accent (Stone, Charcoal, Muted Red) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a strategic narrative for an executive audience, specifically the Chief of Supply Chain. It abandons the linear report format for a more persuasive, interactive flow: 1. Hero section with headline stats to establish scale and urgency. 2. An interactive 'Priorities' section where the user can explore the key challenges, making it feel personalized. 3. A 'Solution Hub' with tabbed navigation, allowing deep dives into the five core Databricks value propositions, each with its own visualization. This breaks down complex solutions into digestible, engaging pieces. 4. A 'Peer Examples' section using tabs to build credibility and show industry precedent. 5. A clear 'Path Forward' section presenting potential POCs as actionable next steps. This structure guides the user from problem to solution to action, which is far more effective for decision-making than a static document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application uses a mix of interactive elements to explain complex ideas simply. Report Info -> Goal -> Viz/Presentation -> Interaction -> Justification. | Key Growth Stats -> Inform/Impress -> Large stat cards (HTML/Tailwind) -> Hover effects -> Immediately shows scale. | Kelby's Priorities -> Organize/Engage -> Clickable cards revealing text -> Personalized exploration of pain points. | Demand Forecasting -> Show Improvement -> Dual Line Chart (Chart.js) -> Hover for data -> Visually proves AI's value over status quo. | Supplier Risk -> Compare States -> Bar Chart + Toggle (Chart.js) -> Button updates chart data -> Makes 'predictive alerts' a tangible concept. | Control Tower -> Explain Architecture -> Diagram (HTML/CSS) -> Hover for info -> Simplifies a complex system visually. | Waste Reduction -> Show Proportions -> Donut Chart (Chart.js) -> Click to update text -> Connects data to a specific solution. | TCO Reduction -> Compare -> Before/After diagrams (HTML/CSS) -> Button toggles views -> Clearly shows simplification. | Peer Examples -> Organize/Inform -> Tabbed Interface -> Click to switch content -> Presents case studies without clutter. | High-Impact Use Cases -> Propose -> Styled info cards -> Hover effects -> Presents next steps as appealing options. All interactions are powered by vanilla JS and Chart.js, using Canvas for all visualizations. -->
